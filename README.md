# JRuby with Sinatra on Heroku Skeleton
=========

This is a bare bones sinatra app skeleton which will enable you to deploy
JRuby apps using sinatra to Heroku.  
Heroku has supported Java for a little while now but documentation and how-to's are scant about deployment.

### Notes
I've personally tested this in March 2012 with JRuby 1.6.7 and it works
fine.

I've included .rvmrc and selected trinidad as the application server.

## Instructions

1.  Install and configure RVM with jruby-1.6.7.
2.  Check this code out from github.

    $ git clone git://github.com/rpocklin/jruby-sinatra-heroku-skeleton.git

3.  Run a script (for the lazy) which will do all the following for you.

    $ provision.sh



If you want to do it manually (or find out what it does...)

1.  Go into the project directory and run:

    $ jruby -S gem install bundler heroku

2.  Edit your Gemfile to update whatever you want in there.

3.  Generate your Gemfile.lock and load dependencies:

    $ jruby -S bundle install

4.  Duplicate the Gemfile to Jemfile so that heroku knows its a JRuby app.

    $ cp Gemfile Gemfile.lock
    $ cp Gemfile.lock Jemfile.lock

5.  Initialise GIT

    $ git init
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Initial commit of repository"

6.  Initialise and push to Heroku (with cedar stack for java) this will give you the application URL (can be renamed by logging in to heroku.com)

    $ heroku create --stack cedar
    $ git push heroku master

Once deployed...

View the install logs

    $ heroku logs

or to tail the logs in production:

    $ heroku logs --tail

Test it responds correctly:

    $ curl http://your_app.heroku.com/..../

and your done!

Note:  You should include your library / app files in config.ru (eg. require 'zing') which is the bootstrap for sinatra.
